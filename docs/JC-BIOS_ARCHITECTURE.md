# JC-BIOS Architecture (JC0)

Purpose
- Define the BIOS responsibilities and data flow for the frozen contracts.

Scope
- JC0 provides structure, contracts, and guards only.
- No runtime firmware, device drivers, or mode transition logic is implemented.

Boot flow (OS view)
- Reset enters P0.
- BIOS reads the BSP anchor to locate the discovery table.
- BIOS validates discovery, builds the normalized capset, and caches the BDT index.
- BIOS initializes mandatory devices (console UART, timer, storage) via the BDT.
- BIOS loads the OS image and transfers control.

Data contracts
- Discovery, capset, topology, and BDT formats are defined in `source/common/spec/`.
- All on-wire layout is validated via `jc_contracts_layout.h`.
- Magic values, versions, sizes, and offsets are generated by `genspec`.

BSP responsibilities
- Provide the BSP anchor address, discovery table, and BDT image.
- No hardcoded device addresses outside the BSP.
- Device binding is by (class, instance) only.

Error handling
- Boot errors use `jc_error_t` from `source/common/include/jc_error.h`.
- Boot is a phase state machine with a persistent `last_error`.
