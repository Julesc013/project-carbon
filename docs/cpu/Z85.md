# Z85 Core (P2 Z80)

## Presentation
- Presented CPU tier: P2 (Z80)
- Feature bit: `CARBON_Z85_UNDOC_Z80`

## Mode and Tier Behavior
- Reset enters P0 (8080 semantics).
- Tier changes only via MODEUP (monotonic upgrade) and RETMD (deterministic return).
- Tier legality: P0 = 8080 subset, P1 = 8085 additions, P2 = full Z80.
- P1 RIM/SIM are deterministic stubs (RIM returns 0; SIM has no side effects).
- Unsupported opcodes trap to the core illegal-instruction cause.

## Undocumented Z80 Behavior
- SLL is implemented in the CB group.
- X/Y flags mirror bits 3/5 of the operand/result per Z80 behavior.
- Unassigned ED opcodes execute as deterministic NOPs (no side effects).

## R Register Policy
- Low 7 bits increment on each opcode/prefix fetch; bit 7 is preserved.

## I/O Ordering
- I/O fabric transactions are ordered and uncached (IO space attribute set; cacheable bit clear).
