legacy_z80_bus_adapter:
  description: Legacy Z80 bus adapter contract compatible with retro backplanes.
  profiles:
    - name: LEGACY_RC2014
      value: 0
      description: RC2014-compatible bus timing profile.
    - name: LEGACY_S100
      value: 1
      description: S-100-compatible bus timing profile.
  requirements:
    - Provides Z80-style MREQ/IORQ bus cycle semantics.
    - Honors WAIT/ready backpressure for slow peripherals.
    - Uses board-defined timing parameters; signal-level timings are not fixed by this spec.

modern_soc_external:
  description: Abstract external memory/peripheral interface for modern SoCs.
  profiles:
    - name: SOC_MEM_GENERIC

      description: Generic synchronous memory interface contract.
    - name: SOC_PERIPH_GENERIC
      value: 17
      description: Generic peripheral interface contract.
  requirements:
    - Bridges to the internal fabric with defined ordering and attribute semantics.
    - Supports burst transfers when the target indicates readiness.

debug_transport:
  minimum: UART
  description: Minimum external debug transport requirement.
  requirements:
    - UART console is always available in safe mode.
    - Baud rate and pin mappings are platform-defined.
