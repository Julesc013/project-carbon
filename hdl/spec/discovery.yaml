transports:
  - name: CPUID
    applies_to: eZ90
    required_tier: P7
    description: CPUID instruction provides the canonical leaf model.
  - name: CAPS
    applies_to: Z85/Z90
    required_tier: P0
    description: CAPS provides a port/CSR mirror of CPUID leaves using the same IDs and packing.
    model:
      mechanism: index_and_data
      behavior:
        - Write the desired leaf ID to CAPS_INDEX.
        - Read CAPS_DATA0..CAPS_DATA3 to obtain the four return words.
        - Implementations may expose CAPS_* as IO ports, CSRs, or both.
      reserved:
        - CAPS transport-specific addressing is platform-defined; only leaf IDs and packing are architectural.
